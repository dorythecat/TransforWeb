# TransforWeb
TransforWeb is the official web companion for the
[TransforMate Discord Bot and API](https://github.com/dorythecat/TransforMate).

It is a purely static site that hosts tools and interfaces to make the most use out
of the bot. For now, this only includes a TSF editor, with the ability to apply
the transformation through the API, but new features will be added on a regular
basis.

Future planned features include:

- The Transformation Roulette
- Server-wide transformations
- Random transformations
- Transformation minigames
- And much more!
